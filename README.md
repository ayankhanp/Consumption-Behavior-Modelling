# 📊 Household Demand Analytics

A business analytics case study evaluating **household-level consumption behaviour** and uncovering demand drivers using demographic, economic, and regional variables. This repository applies exploratory analytics, demand modelling, and segmentation techniques to transform raw purchase data into actionable business insights.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Households display varying product consumption patterns influenced by **income levels, age demographics, regional factors, and promotional exposure**. This repository leverages statistical and analytical methods to answer key business questions:

- What drives household purchase intensity?
- Does household income directly influence consumption?
- Which regional clusters exhibit higher purchase propensity?
- How impactful is promotional exposure on demand?

The dataset consists of **40,000 household-period panel observations**, making it suitable for **predictive analytics**, **demand forecasting**, and **retail decision intelligence**.

## 📌 Preliminary Insights

🟢 Higher-income households tend to purchase more, indicating a **positive demand elasticity**.  
🟢 Certain geographical clusters demonstrate **higher concentration of demand**, suggesting regional targeting opportunities.  
🟢 Promotional exposure (`EXPOS`) appears to uplift consumption, signalling **campaign ROI potential**.  
🟢 A minority of households contribute disproportionately to total purchases, highlighting **strategic customer concentration**.

(Full findings and visualizations are available in the notebooks.)
