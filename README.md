Household Demand Analytics
A business analytics case study exploring household-level consumption behavior and demand drivers across regions
This project analyzes how demographic and economic factors such as income, age, area characteristics, and promotional exposure influence household purchasing intensity for a staple product.
Project Overview
Households differ in their purchasing behavior due to income levels, age demographics, and regional characteristics. This repository applies consumer behavior analytics, panel data exploration, and demand modelling techniques to uncover:
What drives household purchase intensity?
How does income influence consumption patterns?
Which areas exhibit higher demand concentration?
Do promotions and exposure variables materially affect purchases?
The dataset contains 40,000 household-period observations, making it suitable for predictive analytics, market segmentation, and strategic demand insights.
Key Business Questions
✔️ Which household characteristics explain higher purchase volumes?
✔️ Does income significantly influence consumption intensity?
✔️ Which geographical clusters show demand concentration?
✔️ Can promotional exposure increase product uptake?

Preliminary Insights
🟢 Higher-income households exhibit significantly higher purchase intensity.
🟢 Certain areas/clusters demonstrate disproportionately high demand.
🟢 Promotional exposure (EXPOS) shows actionable uplift potential.
🟢 A small fraction of households contribute major demand volume, indicating concentration risk and cross-selling potential.
